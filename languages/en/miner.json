  "t88": "1.Machines hosted: After buying DeepBrain Chain's AI mining machines, the machines can be hosted, trusted with DeepBrain Chain verified professional datacenter, set up by specialist and maintained 24/7.",
  "t89": "2.Advantages of having your machines hosted:",
  "t90": "Experience:",
  "t91": "the two datacenters of choice this time were visited and vetted by DeepBrain Chain's team. They both have years of experience in running a datacenter, they can guarantee high efficiency and smooth operation.",
  "t92": "Electricity rate:",
  "t93": "abundant electricity resources and competitive rate can ensure your profit. ",
  "t94": "Ease of earning:",
  "t95": "you can check the status of your machine and your profit anytime through mining pool. You do not need to have more technical knowledge than anyone else to become a miner, let the specialist worry about the performance of your machine and any other issues after purchase. ",
  "t96": "No noise:",
  "t97": "with the machine hosted somewhere else, you don't need to worry about the noise it will create at home.",
  "t98": "Better ROI:",
  "t99": "For a datacenter that host around 5,000 machines, it takes around 3.5 million RMB and two months to be built. With a datacenter that has complete basic infrastructure you do not need to put in any more money on cost. ",
  "u1": "3.Datacenter model:",
  "u2": "Renting mode:",
  "u3": "customers need to pay a set hosting fee and bandwidth fee to the datacenter monthly. This is more suitable for experienced miners.",
  "u4": "Trustee mode:",
  "u5": "the datacenter will deduct any fees directly from the customer's mining income, no extra knowledge or action needed to take part.",
  "u6": "You need to have already verified your DBC wallet address and filled in your ETH wallet address in your personal account page to be able to pay. ",
  "u7": "Go verify your wallet address&gt;&gt;",
  "u8": "Mining Machine Hosting Procedure",
  "u9": "1. When buying DBC AIM/s, please select you chosen datacenter. (At this stage we have Dragon AI Cloud Computing Datacenter in Fujian, China and UMining in the U.S.)",
  "u10": "2. According to your oder, we will ship your mining machine/s via professional logistic company to your chosen datacenter upon official delivery time.",
  "u11": "3. After the machines are delivered to the corresponding datacenter, trained specialist will set up, test and inform you about your mining machine'operation.",
  "u12": "4. Once the machine/s is set up, the mining starts.",
  "u13": "Datacenters Introduction",
  "u14": "After careful inspections, we have decided from operation experience, basic fees, technical merits, operation merits, security merits and other point of view to choose two datacenters at the end: Umining Datacenter and Dragon AI Cloud Datacenter.
